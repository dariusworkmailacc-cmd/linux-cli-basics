Users and Privileges

## What I practiced
- Identifying the current user with `whoami`
- Viewing user and group information with `id`
- Listing group memberships
- Using `sudo` for administrative actions

## Key concepts
- root user has full system access
- Normal users have limited permissions
- `sudo` grants temporary elevated privileges

## Security notes
- Running as root is powerful but dangerous
- Admin access should be limited and intentional
- Least privilege is a core security principle
